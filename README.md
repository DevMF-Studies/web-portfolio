# Malcolm Felton – Web Portfolio

## About This Project

This is my web portfolio built for my web development course. It includes a home page, a projects page, and a contact page. The site is designed to be responsive and accessible, using semantic HTML, and a Flexbox-based project gallery.

## What I Learned

I learned how to build a consistent layout across multiple pages using <header>, <nav>, <main>, and <footer>, along with headings, and tables. I learned how to create a responsive, card-based project gallery using Flexbox. I learned how to make layouts adapt to different screen sizes with media queries. I learned how to build an accessible contact form with labels and inputs, use alt text for images, and add visual polish with hover states, transitions, and a cohesive color theme.

## Next Steps

If I had more time to continue improving this portfolio, I would add JavaScript and possibly a front-end framework:

Use JavaScript to validate the contact form in real time and show friendly error messages.
Add a dark/light mode toggle that lets the user switch themes, storing their preference in localStorage.
Rebuild the site using a framework like React or a simple static site generator so that repeated sections like the navigation and footer are easier to maintain across pages.
